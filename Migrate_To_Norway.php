                                                <p>Broadly speaking, the award of a residence permit depends on two
                                                    things: your country of citizenship and your ability to financially
                                                    sustain yourself and any dependents. This generally means you need a
                                                    job offer, or you must prove financial sustainability if you are
                                                    coming to Norway to study or for some other reason.

                                                    It is possible for some people to move to Norway as a job seeker,
                                                    but this is only allowed for a relatively short period of time. If
                                                    you don't manage to find employment during that time, you will have
                                                    to leave the country, and there is a waiting period before you will
                                                    be able to return.

                                                    The Department of Immigration (UDI) and the Police are the two
                                                    authorities responsible for managing the immigration process. While
                                                    applications take place in person, the process of booking
                                                    appointments is done online via UDI.</p>

                                                <p>If you've never even visited Norway before, the best thing you can do
                                                    is to plan a trip. You could of course tour the fjords at the height
                                                    of summer, but that will only give you a false impression of
                                                    Norwegian lifestyle.

                                                    Instead, spend some time in your chosen city during the darkness and
                                                    low temperatures of the winter. You'll be living like this for
                                                    months every year, so it's a great idea to give this time of the
                                                    year a “test run” before you decide to move.</p>

                                                        world, they do come with a vastly increased cost of living.
                                                        Because of those same high wages, goods and services are
                                                        more expensive than in almost any other country.

                                                        It's essential to understand the cost of living in your
                                                        chosen part of the country, and the relationship between
                                                        your expected salary and everyday expenses.

                                                        If after thorough research you're still keen on a move to
                                                        Norway, then the next steps depend on your country of
                                                        citizenship.

                                                        Broadly speaking, the rules are split into three overarching
                                                        categories, with an increasing level of difficulty as you
                                                        move down the list:

                                                    <p>People from the other Nordic countries have an easier time with
                                                        the immigration process. Citizens of Sweden, Denmark, Finland
                                                        and Iceland who come to work in Norway must go in person to a
                                                        tax office to obtain a tax deduction card.</p>

                                                    <p>If you plan to stay for more than six months, you must also
                                                        register with the Police. They will check your ID and update the
                                                        National Population Register.

                                                        To register, Nordic citizens just need to show a passport or
                                                        national ID card with a photo and confirmation of your
                                                        citizenship and gender. Alternatively, a valid driving licence
                                                        together with an extract from the National Population Register
                                                        of your home country from within the last three months is also
                                                        acceptable. That's it!</p>

                                                    <p>Citizens of EU/EEA member states have an easier time moving to
                                                        Norway because the country is a member of the EEA. This means
                                                        that Norway abides by the same freedom of movement regulations
                                                        as European Union countries.

                                                        The current EU members are Austria, Belgium, Bulgaria, Croatia,
                                                        Republic of Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland,
                                                        France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Ireland, Italy, Latvia,
                                                        Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, Netherlands, Poland, Portugal,
                                                        Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and the UK.</p>

                                                    <p>The United Kingdom remains an EU member at the time of writing,
                                                        so UK citizens still follow the same rules until their
                                                        post-Brexit arrangements are confirmed. In addition, these rules
                                                        also apply to citizens of Switzerland as the country is an EEA
                                                        member despite being outside the EU. Citizens of Iceland follow
                                                        the rules for Nordic citizens, above.

                                                        What this means is that anyone holding citizenship of one of the
                                                        above countries is permitted to come to Norway for up to six
                                                        months to look for a job.

                                                        To stay beyond that period, a job is required. Read our full

                                                    <p>To apply for Norwegian visa for work, you will need a residence

                                                        the Norwegian Directorate of Immigration website. Requirements
                                                        for a Norway visa vary depending on the visa you are applying
                                                        for. Skilled workers will need a job, and if you are
                                                        self-employed, you and your business will need to meet certain

                                                        It is important to keep in mind that you need to apply for the

                                                        depends on where you are coming from, and even the length of
                                                        time you plan on working in the country. If you are coming from

                                                        skilled worker visa. Once your visa application has been
                                                        submitted, it usually takes about one month for a response.

                                                        It is crucial you work only once you have the right residence
